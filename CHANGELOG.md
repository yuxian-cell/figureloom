# Changelog

## 2026-09-28 — v0.2.0: production Correlation Heatmap

- Added supplied correlation matrices with optional explicit p-values, and the
  validated raw Pearson/two-sided p-value preparation workflow (no correction).
- Origin renders native Matrix Heatmap with 256-level mapping and spectrum;
  Grapher renders native Class Scatter with 21 discrete classes and linked legend.
- Added editable value/star annotations and labels, deterministic physical layout
  frozen in RenderPlan, and Origin Whole Page viewport persistence before save.
- UCI Concrete 1030×9: all six input/backend combinations and representative GUI
  checks passed. Save/reopen/readback/verify and source integrity are retained.
- Legacy Grapher coverage remains 7/41; no generic heatmap, clustering or new
  Heatmap EditPlan. See [release notes](docs/release-v0.2.md) for backend differences,
  validation and remaining limitations.

## 2026-09-07 — SHAP dashboard with editable nested contribution rings

- Added `shap_dashboard`: aligned importance bars with mean/percentage labels, a separate SHAP
  beeswarm with a true 101-level color scale, and nested native group/feature doughnuts.
- Added blue–white–wine, purple–green–yellow, and red–yellow–blue modes. Group hues remain consistent
  between bars and both rings; palette choice is frozen in the plan.
- Reused the SHAP parser and explicit derived-data confirmation. Four source roles are required;
  observations and original files stay unchanged. Existing SHAP plan digests are preserved.
- Included a deterministic 1,440-observation table and three real Origin showcase variants with
  editable OPJU, PNG/PDF/TIF, object readback and visual review.

## 2026-08-13 — Codex current-user handoff and Origin job coordination

- Added a fail-closed Windows execution-context preflight that reads the worker's real security
  token instead of inherited profile variables. A Codex sandbox now stops before COM with
  `origin_codex_sandbox_context` and exposes one narrowly scoped recovery: rerun the same exact
  `origin-smoke` or `render` command only after the corresponding Codex local-execution request is
  approved. Approval is not guaranteed, and the supported route does not use a separate manual
  PowerShell window, administrator rights, DCOM/registry edits, or a sandbox bypass.
- Serialized the active Origin section of current EditaPlot smoke/render workers within one
  signed-in Windows session while keeping data inspection and planning concurrent. Waiting workers
  emit `origin_job_queue` progress, do not promise strict FIFO ordering, and stop only themselves
  after the 30-minute queue limit without interrupting the active holder.
- Preserved activation and cleanup failures as two separate redacted code/stage pairs. The public
  structured payload excludes account names, local paths, raw HRESULTs, and raw COM text, and a
  cleanup failure still blocks further automatic retry.
- Made formal render output reservation atomic so concurrent source-adjacent runs receive distinct
  delivery directories instead of colliding before the Origin job slot is acquired.

## 2026-08-10 — Editable composite SHAP workflow

- Expanded the existing precomputed SHAP route into three column-driven profiles: editable
  beeswarm only, beeswarm plus a linked Mean |SHAP| bar layer, and the full grouped composite with
  an editable contribution pie inset. The source table remains immutable and no model is trained.
- Added optional roles for sample ID, feature order, supplied Mean |SHAP|, feature group, and supplied
  group contribution. Any missing summary derived from supplied SHAP values, within-feature color
  normalization, and deterministic beeswarm offset remain explicit semantic items that require
  confirmation before rendering.
- Implemented the live Origin route with PID201 scatter, a true `Spectrum1` dataset color scale,
  PID215 horizontal bars linked to the beeswarm rows, and optional PID225 Pie2D. Exact helper-column
  bindings, palette direction, layer geometry/linkage, symbol kind/interior, nice top-axis limits,
  default-object cleanup, pie-label state, editable legend objects, and source-X preservation are
  read back and fail closed.
- Replaced the former sparse public fixture with a deterministic 576-row, eight-feature teaching
  table and a real Origin-rendered composite preview. The final run produced editable OPJU plus
  PNG/PDF/TIF, passed object and axis readback, retained the original source values, and passed
  hash-bound human visual review.

## 2026-08-09 — Bounded Origin startup recovery

- Split isolated-instance startup into activation, Origin C readiness, version readback, and project
  initialization so a generic `origin_instance_start_failed` no longer pretends to prove a product,
  data, or installation cause.
- Added one automatic fresh-instance retry for transient activation failures, but only after the
  partial-instance cleanup call returns successfully. Cleanup failure now stops with
  `origin_activation_cleanup_failed`; non-retryable class or access errors also stop immediately.
  No route attaches to a user project or changes DCOM, the registry, administrator settings, or the
  Origin installation.
- Added the documented `sec -poc 30` / `run.isOCready()` readiness gate before version readback or
  project creation. Failed session entry now attempts to close the partially owned instance even
  when successful runs were configured to remain open. An activation-stage cleanup error is reported
  explicitly and blocks every automatic retry.
- Unified redacted recovery metadata between smoke and formal render workers. A user-approved retry
  after both automatic attempts must use a fresh sibling output directory and preserve the first
  diagnostic report.
- Kept worker progress live without force-terminating a Python process that may own a hidden Origin
  instance. If local progress stops for an abnormal duration, preserve the current diagnostics and
  report the last stage instead of risking an unmanaged Origin process.

## 2026-08-09 — Cross-version Origin layer-geometry readback

- Addressed a user-reported OriginPro 2026b SR1 compatibility failure in which the `originpro`
  Automation bridge reported a graph-layer left margin of approximately the layer width (`70.06`
  instead of `17`).
- Made the documented LabTalk layer properties and `layer -x` result the cross-checked geometry
  source of truth. The official `layer -x` order is locked as width, height, left, top; the bridge
  values remain in verification reports as diagnostics; a bridge-only disagreement no longer
  blocks when both native paths agree with the registered contract.
- Kept the gate fail-closed: `layer.unit` must be `1` (% of page), both native readback paths must be
  finite and agree, and the result must still match the registered page/layer contract. A real
  native mismatch continues to stop rendering.
- Applied the shared reader to the smoke, title placement, XPS, generic scientific, categorical,
  network, trajectory3d, and density-ridgeline3d routes. Added deterministic regression coverage
  for stale bridge values, wrong units, non-finite values, command failures, and the non-intuitive
  `v1/v2/v3/v4` mapping.
- Re-ran the complete isolated smoke on the Origin 2024b / 10.15 baseline: editable OPJU,
  PNG/PDF/TIF, page/layer and axis readback, and human PNG inspection all passed. Origin 2026b is
  still a compatibility target, not a newly declared complete real-machine baseline; its user-side
  smoke must be rerun with this release before recording that machine as compatible.

## 2026-08-01 — Verified 3D dual-density ridgeline and baseline locators

- Added the public `density_ridgeline3d` route for a frozen six-role mixed-wide table: condition ID,
  real unit-bearing condition position, unit-bearing density X, paired upstream solid/dashed density,
  and exactly one supplied focal X per condition.
- Kept the scientific boundary explicit: EditaPlot does not run KDE, smooth or normalize the
  profiles, infer peaks/intersections/thresholds, or move the supplied focal marker away from Z=0.
- Completed the Origin 2024b / 10.15 gate with editable OPJU, PNG/PDF/TIF, OpenGL 3D object readback,
  immutable-source verification, and hash-bound human visual QA.
- Expanded the promoted release target to 40 public plotting routes, 47 retained verification PNGs,
  and 45 displayed showcase cases. The two non-displayed heatmaps remain regression evidence.

## 2026-08-01 — Flexible, verified XPS visual styling

- Split the XPS contract into an immutable scientific layer and an independently confirmed visual
  layer. Users may now choose the verified template default, a confirmed approximation suggested
  by a reference figure, or exact custom values without changing source roles or XPS semantics.
- Added exact XPS controls for visible series colors, physical line width, fill transparency,
  physical page size, and legend visibility, frame, and position. Explicit user choices take
  precedence over reference suggestions; invalid exact fields fail before Origin instead of
  silently reverting to a default.
- Updated both adaptive and fixed C 1s Origin runners and the shared preview to consume the same
  visual contract. The runners read back page/layer geometry, Arial typography, line widths,
  series/fill colors, transparency, and editable legend state before reporting success.
- Kept the scientific and API safety contracts unchanged: immutable source data, high-to-low
  binding-energy display, fixed C 1s `PlotX=-BindingEnergy` with `divideBy=-1`, residual retention,
  and the single-region `type=9` / `-pfm 3` two-color fill route.
- Preserved the physical title margins when a custom page width is requested, and reserved an
  8 cm physical column for a readable 24 pt outside-right legend. Too-narrow combinations fail
  visibly rather than clipping or shrinking contracted fonts.
- Fixed the runner boundary for confirmed retain-not-render columns. Such columns remain unchanged
  in an editable `XPS Source Snapshot` worksheet but never enter plot or helper-series logic.
- Verified both XPS routes with Origin 2024b: an adaptive 19 × 19 cm hidden-legend case completed in
  12.4 seconds, and a fixed C 1s 28 × 19 cm outside-right borderless-legend case completed in
  17.6 seconds; each produced editable OPJU plus PNG/PDF/TIF and passed object readback and visual
  inspection.

## 2026-07-31 — Circular-network route and stage timing

- Added a verified multi-panel circular directed weighted network route for `Panel + Source +
  Target + Weight` edge lists, with optional sign, node-group, and edge-label columns.
- Kept node positions stable across panels, applied one global weight-to-line-width scale, and
  rendered editable Origin curves, terminal arrow objects, direct labels, and a borderless legend.
- Promoted the route only after a real Origin 2024b run produced OPJU, PNG, PDF, and TIF artifacts,
  passed object/font/color/size readback, preserved the source table, and passed image-bound human
  visual review.
- Added monotonic `elapsed_seconds` to worker progress events and documented stage-level diagnosis:
  up to roughly four or five minutes is a reasonable normal range for an already prepared
  ordinary workflow, while a silent 30–60 minute wait is abnormal and should be localized before
  retrying.
- Kept full Origin readback in `origin_verify_report.json` while making the terminal success event
  concise.
- Expanded the public inventory to 39 plotting routes, 46 reviewed verification PNGs, and 44
  displayed examples.

## 2026-07-30 — Scientific understanding, compatibility, and release hardening

- Added a confirmation-first scientific understanding layer that classifies every source column as
  plotted evidence, visible support, calculation/validation only, retained without rendering, or
  unresolved before a RenderPlan can be approved.
- Added safe reference-figure adaptation: local PNG/JPEG/TIFF files may guide compatible figure
  grammar and restrained style choices, but never supply copied data, text, fits, phases, logos,
  watermarks, or a promised 1:1 reproduction.
- Expanded the Origin/OriginPro 2021–2026b compatibility layer with isolated-instance startup,
  live version handshake, per-template capability decisions, stable Automation errors, and explicit
  reporting that 2024b remains the only complete live baseline.
- Added and verified materials routes and data contracts for GSAS/GSAS-II XRD Rietveld, XAS,
  PL/TRPL, DSC, NMR, FTIR/IR, UV–Vis/Tauc, XPS comparison, and high-density heatmaps.
- Consolidated the public gallery around 38 Origin plotting routes, 45 reviewed verification PNGs,
  and 43 displayed cases. The gallery now shows one Origin-rendered 30×30 dense heatmap while
  retaining the smaller and 40×40 cases only as regression evidence.
- Documented the minimum Codex permissions for Windows beginners, source-adjacent delivery folders,
  Python discovery and consent boundaries, and a clearer split between local runtime behavior and
  the user's Codex account or organization data policy.
- Hardened setup, worker launch, GUI subprocess environment inheritance, smoke-output preparation,
  source-adjacent delivery writes, and path redaction so common Windows policy, antivirus, cloud
  sync, missing-executable, and permission failures return short stable errors instead of tracebacks
  or a stalled interface.
- Added final release gates for public-template alignment, hidden regression-gallery entries,
  runtime and asset manifests, provenance exactness, Windows permissions, and dense-heatmap layout.
- Added a final optional “buy me a coffee” section to both READMEs using an author-approved,
  metadata-free WeChat Pay QR image. Tips do not unlock features, change support priority, or alter
  Apache-2.0 rights.

## 2026-07-22 — Beginner onboarding and simplified public release

- Added a Windows launcher that discovers a compatible 64-bit CPython 3.10–3.12 even when the
  user's default `python` command is missing, stale, or points to an unsupported version.
- Added idempotent `editaplot.cmd setup`: it installs or updates the Skill, records the complete
  bundled runtime, prepares an audited project-local environment, and runs a post-setup doctor.
- Added guarded migration for complete pre-bootstrap EditaPlot installations; unrelated or
  incomplete non-empty directories remain protected from overwrite.
- Strengthened doctor with a single Python compatibility policy and read-only Origin Automation
  discovery. Origin readiness is technical only: render performs the actual connection attempt,
  without an additional Origin confirmation gate.
- Added a beginner `start` workflow for read-only data recognition, ranked chart suggestions, and
  plain-language scientific confirmation before any plan or render is created.
- Made the V1 boundary explicit: physical Windows 10/11 x64 only; macOS, Linux, WSL,
  Wine/CrossOver, Parallels, and other VMs are unsupported.
- Added a compact GitHub Star badge and privacy-first daily trend. The updater reads only GitHub's
  aggregate `stargazers_count`, stores date plus total count, and never requests account identities
  or personal Star timestamps.
- Changed the default render destination to a unique `<source_stem>_EditaPlot_<time>` folder beside
  the original table, with the approved RenderPlan copied into the complete artifact set.
- Extended public CI coverage to CPython 3.10, 3.11, and 3.12 while preserving the existing
  `windows-python-310` protected-branch check.

## 2026-07-21 — Initial open-source release

- Adopted the neutral public brand **EditaPlot**, repository slug `editaplot`, and Skill ID
  `editaplot`; released project-owned work under Apache-2.0.
- Added 10 machine-checkable scientific palettes, an eight-palette Chinese launch selector,
  advanced-risk metadata, palette compatibility gates, and RenderPlan/worker palette freezing.
- Added doctor repair tiers and project-local Python dependency repair without installing or
  modifying Origin.
- Bundled a minimal self-contained EditaPlot rendering runtime with a SHA-256 manifest.
- Added bilingual README/quick starts, prompts, privacy/security/support/release boundaries, a
  version-specific dependency inventory, and a GitHub-safe gallery of 37 reviewed Origin PNG examples.
- Added explicit public-versus-commercial release gates for irreversible GitHub disclosure,
  OriginLab commercial-automation/trademark clarification, and PySide6/Qt redistribution.
- Promoted the verified `trajectory3d` route for explicit `Zreal + real third variable with unit +
  -Zimag + Series` long tables after editable OPJU, PNG/PDF/TIF, 3D object readback, source-hash,
  and human visual QA passed.
- Verified the official Origin 3D Waterfall API in isolation; kept it experimental because visible
  OpenGL fill/edge colors did not match successful object-level color-list readback.
