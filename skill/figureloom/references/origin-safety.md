# Origin Automation safety gate

## Compatibility scope and evidence

- The external route is Windows-only and targets a locally installed Origin or OriginPro 2021 or
  later. The current target matrix is 2021, 2021b, 2022, 2022b, 2023, 2023b, 2024, 2024b, 2025,
  2025b, 2026, and 2026b. Origin 2020b and earlier remain outside this route.
- Origin 2024b / 10.15 is the current complete end-to-end real-machine baseline. It is not a hard
  upper-version gate.
- Do not describe every other target version as verified. For any non-baseline build, compatibility
  is decided by the actual Automation handshake, the capabilities required by the selected
  template, and real output evidence from that machine.
- Real output evidence means a non-empty editable OPJU, PNG/PDF/TIF exports, required axis/text
  object readback, and human visual inspection. A successful import, version string, or PNG alone
  is insufficient.
- A recognized product or build may carry `known_version_risks`. These records only raise or
  normalize `probe_priority`; they never block a render by version number alone.
- If the product/build is unknown or the returned version value cannot be parsed while Automation
  remains callable, report `version_status=unknown`, use high probe priority, and run the complete
  capability probe. Never silently label that environment supported or verified.
- A genuine Automation handshake/readback failure remains a technical failure. Report the stable
  stage and error code without guessing why it failed.
- Classify common activation failures without exposing the original COM exception:
  `0x80004005` as `origin_com_unspecified_failure`, `0x80080005` as
  `origin_com_server_execution_failed`, `0x80040154` as `origin_com_class_not_registered`,
  `0x80070005` as `origin_com_activation_access_denied`, and common RPC busy/disconnect conditions
  by their dedicated stable codes. Inspect exception HRESULT attributes as well as nested args.

## Environment boundary

- Readiness means technical callability only: package import, Automation connection, version
  readback when available, program-path readback, ready-state command, capability probes, and
  evidence production.
- Do not ask the user to confirm any non-technical product or account state. Those questions are
  outside the Skill's diagnostics.
- Doctor performs read-only discovery and does not launch Origin. The real pre-render smoke starts
  the dedicated instance and validates the live route.
- Before any Origin COM call, classify the process from its real Windows token rather than inherited
  `USERNAME` or `USERPROFILE` values. `codex_sandbox` stops before COM with
  `origin_codex_sandbox_context`; `unknown` Windows identity also stops fail-closed with
  `origin_execution_context_unknown`.
- For `origin_codex_sandbox_context`, Codex may submit a formal, narrowly scoped local-execution
  request for the same exact `origin-smoke` or `render` command. Rerun only if that exact request is
  approved, either by the user when prompted or by the configured Codex auto-reviewer. Approval is
  not guaranteed, auto-review does not pre-grant Origin access, and this handoff is not a sandbox
  bypass. Do not ask the user to copy the command into another PowerShell session.
- Never install, replace, patch, or modify the Origin application. Runtime dependency setup is
  limited to the project-local Python environment.
- Never modify DCOM permissions, COM registration, registry keys, local groups, or Origin launch
  settings as an automatic recovery step. Do not make administrator mode the normal execution
  route.

## Instance lifecycle

- Use the external `originpro` / Origin Automation Server route.
- Use `launch_isolated` / `new_isolated` by default. The Skill starts and owns a dedicated Origin
  instance, visible or hidden as needed; the user does not need to open an Origin window in advance.
- The isolated route follows the official `Application` behavior, which creates a new instance.
- Allow `attach_existing` only when explicitly requested. Do not create a project, call `new`, reset
  state, overwrite work, hide the window, or call `exit()` in a user-owned session; detach instead.
- Only an FigureLoom-owned instance may create a fresh project automatically or be closed by the
  runtime.
- If isolated activation partially starts and raises, perform one `op.exit()` cleanup attempt. A
  retryable code may start one fresh FigureLoom-owned `Application` instance automatically only when
  that cleanup succeeds. Cleanup failure reports `origin_activation_cleanup_failed` and stops;
  class-unavailable and access-denied codes also stop immediately. Do not call `set_show(True)`
  after an entry failure.
- After activation, wait with `sec -poc 30` and require a finite true `run.isOCready()` value before
  version readback or project creation. A failed entry always attempts to exit the owned instance;
  keep-open applies only after `__enter__` completed. Later entry failures stop without retry even
  when their best-effort cleanup cannot be confirmed.
- After the automatic attempt is exhausted, allow at most one user-approved retry in the active
  interactive Windows-user context. Use a new empty sibling smoke directory and preserve the first
  report. Do not fall back to `ApplicationSI`.
- Keep that post-activation retry distinct from the Codex execution-context handoff: sandbox
  detection happens before COM and cannot be diagnosed as an Origin activation failure.
- Serialize only the active Origin section of current FigureLoom `origin-smoke` and `render` workers
  within one signed-in Windows session. Data inspection, recommendation, and planning may remain
  concurrent. Waiting workers report `origin_job_queue` immediately and then about every 30 seconds;
  strict FIFO ordering is not guaranteed. The 30-minute maximum applies only to the waiter. On
  `origin_job_queue_timeout`, stop the waiting worker without killing or interrupting the holder.
  Do not submit a duplicate while waiting. Manual scripts, older FigureLoom releases, and unrelated
  programs are not coordinated by this slot.
- Do not force-terminate a smoke or render Python worker solely because of elapsed time. It may own
  a hidden Origin instance, and Windows process termination skips Origin's normal cleanup path.
  Preserve diagnostics, report the last progress stage, and require a proven cooperative cleanup
  path before adding any automatic hard timeout.
- Never use mouse or screen-coordinate automation.

## Version-sensitive rendering

- Treat graph defaults as version-sensitive. Origin 2025b changed page geometry, margins, text
  sizing, frames, line widths, and tick-label rotation defaults; write explicit style contracts and
  verify object state instead of relying on defaults.
- Keep version-risk records advisory. They prioritize focused probes such as label geometry,
  categorical ticks, error bars, secondary-axis titles, and reference-line rescaling.
- A known fixed build still receives its required probe at normal priority. A known affected or
  unknown build receives the probe at high priority.
- Never modify global Graph Options, system themes, or `@GGO` to make one render pass.
- For percent-of-page layer geometry, require `layer.unit=1`. Cross-check the documented LabTalk
  `layer.left/top/width/height` properties against `layer -x`; map `v1=width`, `v2=height`,
  `v3=left`, and `v4=top`. Never treat `v1` as the left margin.
- Keep originpro `GetNumProp` geometry as bridge diagnostics. If both native LabTalk paths are
  finite, agree, and match the registered contract, a stale bridge value may be reported without
  blocking. If the native paths disagree, the unit is not 1, or either path is unavailable, fail
  closed. Do not hard-code an Origin-version bypass or a tolerated `70.06` value.

## Stable execution routes

- Keep unverified LabTalk and X-Function experiments outside public renderers.
- Never use `-pfm 4` or unverified More Colors parameters.
- Keep the verified XPS fill route: one fill region, `set_fill_area(..., type=9)`, and `-pfm 3`.
- Preserve the stable XPS negative PlotX and label divide-by route; do not replace it with
  `x.reverse=1`.
- Treat user-requested XPS colors, physical line widths, fill transparency, safe page/aspect ratio,
  and legend show/hide, borderless, or position as independent capability-gated cosmetic fields.
  Apply and report a field only after the exact Origin write/readback route is verified; otherwise
  retain the registered default or reject it. A reference image is never sufficient authorization.
- Cosmetic overrides must not change source values or column roles, the binding-energy direction,
  component identity, or the single-region XPS fill API above.
- Do not write right/top-axis label properties known to contaminate the paired bottom/left axes.

## Data and diagnostics

- Hash the source before inspection and check it again before render.
- Never overwrite the source or add fabricated source columns.
- Store helper columns only in memory or the Origin workbook copy and report their purpose.
- Redact private absolute paths and local Origin environment details from public logs and examples.
- If activation and cleanup both fail, publish only `primary_activation_code`,
  `primary_activation_stage`, `cleanup_error_code`, and `cleanup_error_stage` in the structured
  diagnostic payload. Do not include an account name, local path, raw HRESULT, or raw COM text, and
  do not authorize another automatic retry merely because both diagnostic pairs are present.
- Keep beginner-facing environment output to one to three plain-language sentences. Store detailed
  stages, detected Automation entries, candidates, risks, probes, and failures in local structured
  diagnostics.
- Never promote a Python preview or standalone PNG/PDF/SVG after an Automation failure. Formal
  completion still requires OPJU, PNG, PDF, TIF, object readback, and human visual QA.

## Experimental API rule

Before adding a new Origin graph route:

1. Read the local API playbook and the relevant official Origin documentation.
2. Build a minimal isolated experiment.
3. Save to a dedicated test output directory.
4. Require editable OPJU, PNG/PDF/TIF, object readback, and human visual inspection.
5. Promote the route to `verified` only after all checks pass.
